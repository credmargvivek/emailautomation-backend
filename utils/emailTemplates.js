      body: `Hi ${firstName},
  
  PR reviews are one of the biggest drains on engineering time â€” some teams see them eat up 40% of dev hours. At companies like Acme and Orion, Ovam helped reduce PR-to-merge cycles by up to 60%, without extra headcount.
  
  ðŸš€ Faster launches â†’ ship days earlier by cutting review cycles
  ðŸ’¸ Lower cost per feature â†’ devs spend more time coding, less waiting
  ðŸ”’ Stronger reliability â†’ automated bug detection + security scans before merge
  
  Would you be open to a 15-min walkthrough? I can show you how teams your size are saving weeks of engineering time each quarter.

    prReview2: ({ firstName, company, from }) => ({
      subject: `How Acme saved 12+ hours/week in PR reviews`,
      body: `Hi ${firstName},
  
  At Acme, developers were losing over 12 hours every week stuck in review queues. After adopting Ovam, reviews moved in hours instead of days â€” freeing engineers to ship features faster.
  
  ðŸš€ Faster cycles â†’ PRs reviewed in hours, not days  
  ðŸ’¸ More bandwidth â†’ devs focus on innovation, not waiting  
  ðŸ”’ Fewer bugs â†’ early detection before merge  
  
  Would you like to see how ${company} could unlock a similar time savings? Happy to show you in a short demo.

    jiraSlack: ({ firstName, company, from }) => ({
      subject: `End the Jira + Slack scavenger hunt`,
      body: `Hi ${firstName},
  
  Finding updates across Jira and Slack shouldnâ€™t feel like a scavenger hunt. Ovam integrates directly so your team never loses context, and engineers donâ€™t waste time searching for tickets or threads.
  
  ðŸš€ Less context-switching â†’ everything in one place  
  ðŸ’¸ Higher productivity â†’ no wasted hours chasing info  
  ðŸ”’ Better accountability â†’ every update is tracked  
  
  Would you be open to a quick walkthrough? Iâ€™ll show you how ${company} can simplify collaboration instantly.
